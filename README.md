## DATA 1030 PROJECT: Fare Enough:  Building ML Models for Predicting Uber Fare Amount 

## Project Overview

In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle Platform to predict the Uber Fare Amount. This is a regression problem with a large dataset.

Motivation: For passengers taking the rides, analyzing fare prediction would help them to anticipate the cost of trips, providing them guidance in choosing optimal travel time; for drivers, a better understanding of the pricing strategy of the platform can optimize their trip selection and deliver them with earning forecasts; companies like Uber can adjust their pricing models to balance supply and demand efficiently, ensuring that riders are incentivized to use the service while drivers are motivated to meet demand during peak times.
